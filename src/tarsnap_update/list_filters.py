    """Select entries in target that satisfy the specified spacing_params

    space_by_span examines the elements in target from first to last and
    selects those that are spaced apart enough to satisfy the parameters in
    spacing_params. spacing_params consists of a set of target element spacings
    and target element bounds. For each element, the only spacing/bound pair
    that applies is the one with the smallest bound that is greater than the
    distance from the element to the first element of target.

    The elements of target are examined one by one and either selected or not
    selected. The first element and last element for each spacing are always
    selected. Elements subsequent to the first in a spacing set are selected if
    they are the closest to being one spacing away from the previous element
    (without being more than 1.05 * spacing away; the 5% extra is to allow for
    some tolerance of edge cases).

    target: a list of items that can be subtracted from each other to calculate
        spacings
    spacing_params: a list of 2-element tuples where the first element is a
        spacing and the second element is a bound. The list should be ordered
        from smallest to largest spacings and bounds.
    reverse: target is copied and sorted inside the function before applying
        spacings. reverse sets whether or not the list is reversed after
        sorting.

    return: list of indices of elements from target that were selected

    Notes
    * The last spacing applies to all elements that do not match the earliera
    spacings even if those elements are outside the last bound
    * If the spacings in target are very different from the spacings in
    spacing_params, the resulting subset of target might have a fairly
    different spacing from the spacing params. This is a consequence of always
    trying to save one subsequent item within a spacing of the last item, even
    if the two are close. This behavior was chosen because it is more
    conservative than trying to maintain the spacing as closely as possible
    (which can have the side effect of throwing out all elements as they cross
    a certain bound when space_by_span is called repeatedly on a list each time
    a new element is added to the beginning of it).
